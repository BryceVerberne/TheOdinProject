    Notes:
     - Even though `body` specifies the color as green, the paragraph is firebrick, why? As you can see
       the color firebrick is specified in our `p` which is more specific to the situation than body, 
       which is more obscure and broad. This means that the system will favor firebrick instead of green.

     - Blue is the default style of our links, established by the browser. However, we can overcome
       this by using the `<a>` tag. As you can see above, we change this default to the color black
       by using `color: black;`.

     - We can also create a hover effect with links, which includes something called psuedo classes.

     - A psuedo class is a selector that we can use that will select the element in different states 
       of being. In this case, we can use `a:hover`, which means that the `<a>` tag will exhibit the 
       properties we specify when we hover over a link with our cursor. 

     - You can change far more properties than just color with hover, such as font style, font family, 
       font size, and many other qualities.
