/*
    There are several different ways of using the `margin` property, including
    the manipulation of each side individually. The following properties do just
    that:
     - margin-top
     - margin-right
     - margin-bottom
     - margin-left

    Although margin is what is being discussed in this example, these concepts also
    apply to many other sizing features, such as padding and border.
