    <p>
        These are all children of the root element. Therefore, `rem` and `em` are going to
        behave the exact same since the parent font size is the same as the root font size.

    <div class="parent">
        <div class="one-rem">1rem</div>
        <div class="one-em">1em</div>
        <div class="two-rem">2rem</div>
        <div class="two-em">2em</div>

        <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
            Inside the `parent` we have defined a new font size. This means that `em` is going
            to change according to the parent's font size. However, given that `rem` only takes 
            into consideration the root font size, it does not change, which can be seen when 
            comparing it to the example above.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1rem">
            Given that the 1 in-front of `em` and `rem` stands for 100% the font size, by putting
            a 2 in-front of them means that we want 200% the font size. Therefore, if the root
            font size is 16px, `2rem` will have a font size of 32px, and if the parent font size 
            is 30px, `2em` will have a font size of 60px.
        </p>

    <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon em-icon"></div>
        <span class="icon-text">1em icon</span>
    </div>

    <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon rem-icon"></div>
        <span class="icon-text">1rem icon</span>
    </div>

    <div class="icon-container large">
        <div class="icon em-icon"></div>
        <span class="icon-text">1em icon</span>
    </div>

    <div class="icon-container large">
        <div class="icon rem-icon"></div>
        <span>1rem icon</span>
    </div>

    <p>
        By using `em` with shapes, as we scale up the font size, so does the size of the box. 
        This is why the third box is so large. We scaled the font up to 30px, meaning that our
        box is accounting for this new font size. However, `rem` stays the same since it remains
        true to the root font size. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, `em` is great since it provides scaling capabilities and `rem` is useful for 
        when you want to set a font to the base size, even if you are unsure of what that is.
