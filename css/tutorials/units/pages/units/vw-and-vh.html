    <div class="parent">
        <div class="box fifty-percent">50%</div>
        <div class="box fifty-vw">50vw</div>
        <div class="box twenty-five-vh">25vh</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        For every unit of vw or vh, that is a percentage of the screen that you are taking up.
        Therefore, 50vw will take up 50% of the width screen and 50vh will take up 50% of the 
        height of the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        How is this any different from percentages? Well, percentages are relative to their 
        parent. So, if you have a parent box that has a width of 100px, and you have a box inside
        this parent that is assigned a width of 50%, it will take up 50px of the parent box. On 
        the other hand, vw and vh do not take into consideration their parents. Therefore, if we 
        replaced 50% will 50vw, it would take up 50% of the entire screen width and ignore the 
        parent box of 100px.
