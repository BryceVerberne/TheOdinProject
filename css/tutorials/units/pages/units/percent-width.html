    <hr>

    <div class="parent">
        <div class="box fifty-percent">50%</div>
        <div class="box one-hundred-pixels">100px</div>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you can see, 50% takes up 50% of its parent's size. So, in the first
        example, given that the only restraint is the webpage itself, the box
        fills up half of the webpage. On the other hand, our second example is 
        smaller since it is taking up half the width of the parent box we 
        created for it.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we take a look at 100px, it tells a different story. The size of the 
        box isn't relative to anything when we are dealing with pixels, so that
        is why we have the same size box for both examples.
