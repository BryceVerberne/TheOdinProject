/*
  This example has three different HTML elements, all of which have an outer display type of `block`.

  1. A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. The paragraph 
     starts on a new line and extends the entire available width.
  2. A list, which is laid out using `display: flex`. This establishes flex layout for the children 
     of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.
  3. A block-level paragraph, inside which are two `<span>` elements. These elements would normally be 
     `inline`, however, one of the elements has a class of "block" which gets set to `display: block`.
