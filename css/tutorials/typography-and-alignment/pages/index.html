    <!-- Add paragraph, set font family, & font size. -->
    <p>CSS controls the look of text on webpages, including font type through 
        `font-family`. Multiple fonts are listed as fallbacks in a "font stack" for 
        compatibility. Styles can be applied in the HTML or through an external CSS
        file. Predefined HTML tags like `body`, `h1`, `p` are used as selectors in 
        CSS to automatically style those HTML elements. This allows customization 
        and a consistent user experience across webpages.</p>
