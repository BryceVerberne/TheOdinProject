    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Italian Chicken Marinade, is a wonderful amalgamation of robust and 
        bold Italian flavors, promising to bring life to any piece of chicken. 
        Crafted from a delectable mix of pantry staples such as olive oil, 
        balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and honey, this 
        marinade has a balance of sweet, tangy, and savory notes. It's the 
        kind of marinade that adds depth to the chicken, making it a perfect 
        main course for any day of the week.</p>

    <p>The richness of the olive oil merges seamlessly with the slight acidity 
        of the balsamic vinegar, enhancing the aroma and flavor of the chicken. 
        The minced garlic and Italian seasoning infuse an earthy flavor, a nod 
        to classic Italian cuisine. The touch of honey in the marinade introduces 
        a subtle sweetness that rounds out the flavor profile. Optional Dijon 
        mustard or Parmesan cheese can add a tangy or creamy note to the mix, 
        offering a versatile base for various chicken dishes.</p>

    <!-- Provide step-by-step directions of how to make the dish -->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow 
            baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish 
            with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to 
            overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining 
            marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center 
            and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
