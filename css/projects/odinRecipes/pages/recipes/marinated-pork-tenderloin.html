    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Marinated Grilled Pork Tenderloin is a succulent dish that expertly 
        combines a variety of flavors. The tenderloin is marinated in a rich 
        mix of orange juice, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, and fresh rosemary. 
        This fusion of tangy citrus, savory soy, aromatic garlic, and the 
        woody undertones of rosemary creates a deep, multi-layered flavor 
        profile that makes each bite of pork an unforgettable experience.</p>

    <p>The pork tenderloin itself, due to its marinating process and grilling 
        technique, emerges juicy and tender, with a delightful smoky char. The 
        marinade not only imparts an exciting mix of tastes but also helps to 
        tenderize the meat, resulting in a main course that's both flavorful 
        and satisfyingly tender. This dish showcases how simple ingredients, 
        when combined with the right techniques, can elevate a humble cut of 
        meat to a gourmet delicacy.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make marinade: Whisk together honey, soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown 
            sugar, ginger, ketchup, garlic, parsley, onion powder, cayenne 
            pepper, and cinnamon in a medium bowl; pour into a resealable plastic
            bag.</li>
        <li>Place pork tenderloins into the bag; coat with marinade, squeeze out
            excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at 
            least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove pork tenderloins from marinade; shake off excess. Discard 
            remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook pork tenderloins on the preheated grill until no longer pink in 
            the center, 20 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees 
            F (63 degrees C).</li>
