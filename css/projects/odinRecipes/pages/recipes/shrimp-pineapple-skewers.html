    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers are a 
        delightful blend of succulent shrimp and sweet pineapple, enhanced
        by a homemade teriyaki sauce. This sauce, featuring soy sauce, 
        mirin, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger, balances sweet, salty, and 
        umami flavors, creating a unique, tasty marinade for the shrimp. 
        Finished with sesame seeds and green onions, the dish boasts 
        additional crunch and a vibrant color palette.</p>

    <p>In this recipe, the shrimp, marinated in the teriyaki sauce and then
        grilled, is a flavor-packed star. The addition of grilled pineapple
        provides a sweet, slightly charred counterpoint to the savory
        shrimp. Served on skewers, this pairing becomes an easy-to-handle,
        festive dish â€“ a delightful culinary creation merging simple 
        ingredients with rich flavors.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger
             in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
             Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and
              thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil 
            grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and 
            place on a platter.</li>
        <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, 
            or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low 
            heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a 
            serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
