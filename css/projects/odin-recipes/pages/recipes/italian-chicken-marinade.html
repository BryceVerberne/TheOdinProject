        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow 
                baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish 
                with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to 
                overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining 
                marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center 
                and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An 
                instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
