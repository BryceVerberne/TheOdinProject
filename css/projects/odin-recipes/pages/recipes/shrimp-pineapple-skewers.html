        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger
                 in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                 Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and
                  thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil 
                grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and 
                place on a platter.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, 
                or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low 
                heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a 
                serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
