/*
Add the following to the DOM:
<div class="content">
    This is the glorious text-content!
</div>
*/


/*
Make the following modifications to the DOM:
1. A <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
2. An <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
3. A <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
  - Another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”
  - A <p> that says “ME TOO!”
Hint for this one: after creating the <div> with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container.
