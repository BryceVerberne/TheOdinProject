# Temperature Converter

The Temperature Converter is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This project demonstrates the basic concepts of variables, operators, assignments, and arithmetic in JavaScript.

## Functionality

The Temperature Converter program performs the following tasks:

- Prompts the user to enter a temperature value.
- Prompts the user to specify the temperature scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- Converts the temperature value to the opposite scale using the appropriate formula.
- Displays the converted temperature to the user.

## Concepts Covered

The Temperature Converter project covers the following fundamental concepts of JavaScript:

- Variables: The project uses variables to store the user's input, temperature values, and the converted result.
- Operators: Arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are used to perform the temperature conversion.
- Assignments: The project demonstrates how to assign values to variables and update them based on user input and calculations.
- Arithmetic: The conversion formulas involve basic arithmetic operations to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Usage

To use the Temperature Converter project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `temperature-converter.js` file in a JavaScript-enabled web browser or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. When prompted, enter the temperature value you want to convert.
3. Specify the temperature scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit) by following the instructions provided.
4. The program will calculate and display the converted temperature.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the Temperature Converter:

```
Please enter the temperature value: 32
Specify the temperature scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit): Celsius
The equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit is 89.6Â°F.
