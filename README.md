# Web Development Learning

Hello, world! Welcome to my web development learning repository. As I journey through the realms of web development, I'll be documenting my progress here. This repository is my sandbox where I'll be experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.

## Learning Resources

I will be using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open-source project that's community-driven and aims to provide a comprehensive path to learning web development. I'll be following their _Foundations_ and _Full Stack JavaScript_ routes.

### Foundations

The [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations) route serves as an introduction to web development, covering basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and more. It's a stepping stone to the more advanced topics, and all the learning is done by building projects.

### Full Stack JavaScript

The [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) route dives deeper into JavaScript and covers the front and back ends. This includes client-side JavaScript, server-side JavaScript with Node.js, and databases with SQL and MongoDB.

## Repository Structure

Each major topic or project will have its own directory in this repository. The structure will be intuitive and easy to navigate. Expect to see directories named after the relevant languages or topics, like `html`, `css`, `javascript`, `nodejs`, etc.

## Contributions

While this repo primarily serves as a personal record of my learning journey, I welcome any constructive feedback, suggestions, and pull requests. Please feel free to fork this repository, and if you have something interesting to add, don't hesitate to make a pull request!
